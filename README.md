This is a repository for the resources utilized for the KGSWC 2021 submission, "Institute Demographic Ontology (InDO)". We contribute the following publicly available artifacts: <strong>InDO</strong> with the <strong>institute's overall and specific demographics</strong> and <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> to run our competency questions, along with the applicable documentation available on our resource website, to be useful resources for anyone interested in building insitute's demographic facilities into their systems. Our resource can be accessed from: https://tetherless-world.github.io/institute-demographic-ontology/

Institute Demographic Ontology Instances (Knowledge Graph): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tetherless-world/institute-demographic-ontology/main/Ontology/indo_indi.owl<br/>

SPARQL Queries can be accessed from our website and run against the InDO to reproduce results that we show at: https://tetherless-world.github.io/institute-demographic-ontology/competencyquestions/#sparql
We ran these queries using the Blazegraph Workbench.
